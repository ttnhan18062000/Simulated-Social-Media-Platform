# 🧠 LLM-Driven Realistic Post Generation

## 🔧 Core Tech Stack

- **LangGraph** – For building multi-step, agentic workflows (memory, branching decisions, goals).
- **LangChain or Guidance** – Optional layer for prompt templating, memory management.
- **OpenAI/GPT-4o or Claude 3** – For rich language generation (realistic post content).
- **Vector DB (Weaviate / Pinecone / Chroma)** – To store user memories, past post topics, interests.
- **Pydantic + FastAPI / Litestar** – For clean API schema/logic integration.

## 🧬 Agent Workflow Architecture (via LangGraph)

### 🎭 1. User Persona Agent
- Embodies personality traits (e.g., sarcastic teen, curious engineer, tired parent).
- Driven by embeddings + memory (via Vector DB) + temporal context (time of day).

### 🧠 2. Context Builder Node
- Checks:
  - What did the user post before?
  - What time is it (sleeping? relaxing?)?
  - What events/posts happened recently?
- Constructs a context object for the post generation node.

### ✍️ 3. Post Generator Node
- Uses LLM to:
  - Generate meaningful content with topics of interest.
  - React to recent posts (simulate social behavior).
  - Post with various tones (funny, serious, emotional).
